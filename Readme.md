# 🐍 Snake-Water-Gun Game (Python Console Version)

A fun little console-based game inspired by the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" — but with a twist! Instead of rocks and paper, it's **Snake**, **Water**, and **Gun**. This mini project is coded in Python and demonstrates basic input/output, conditionals, and randomization.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Run the Python script.
- Input your choice:
  - `s` for Snake
  - `w` for Water
  - `g` for Gun
- The computer will randomly choose one as well.
- The winner is determined based on the rules:

## 🧠 Rules

- **Snake drinks Water** → Snake wins 🐍💧
- **Water douses Gun** → Water wins 💧🔫
- **Gun kills Snake** → Gun wins 🔫🐍
- Same choices → It's a draw 🤝

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Save the file as `snake_water_gun.py`.
2. Open terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python snake_water_gun.py
```

## 🛠 Code Preview

```python
import random
'''
1 for snake
-1 for water
0 for gun
'''
computer = random.choice([-1,0,1])
youstr = input("Enter your choice: ")
youDict = {"s": 1,"w": -1,"g": 0}
reverseDict = {1:"Snake",-1:"Water",0:"Gun"}

you = youDict[youstr]

print(f"You chose {reverseDict[you]}\nComputer chose {reverseDict[computer]}")

if(computer==you):
    print("It is a draw")
else:
    if(computer==-1 and you==1):
        print("You Win!")
    elif(computer==-1 and you==0):
        print("You Loose!")
    elif(computer==1 and you==-1):
        print("You Loose!")
    elif(computer==1 and you==0):
        print("You Win!")
    elif(computer==0 and you==-1):
        print("You Win!")
    elif(computer==0 and you==1):
        print("You Loose!")
    else:
        print("Something Went Wrong!")
```

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Add input validation
- Track scores
- Add GUI using Tkinter or PyQt
- Multiplayer mode
